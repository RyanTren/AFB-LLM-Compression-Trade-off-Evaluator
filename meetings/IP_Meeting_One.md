# Meeting 1 - Industry Partner Meeting
* Date - 9/3/25
* Goal: Optimize Usage of LLMs offline for Robin AFB, using compression techniques on focusing on an open-source LLM of our choice, comparing model size and inference quality (i.e.code debugging and changing a set of code from one language or another.)

## Industry Partners:
- LT Ayerdi AFSC/EN - person answering most of the questions
- Aquesha Dawson
- Lesya (Ukrane) - point of contact from tinker (electrical engineering background)

## General Details/Topics Scope of Work
- reducing parmater size and computation costs
- code generation tasks
- Highest ROI on changing coding languages - code debugging or changing a set of code from one language or another
- Model choice is up to us (they use Llama currently and don't really have a "good" llm they use currently)
- Compare how each compression method affects the model size and using a metric tracker to report back to Robins AFB
- **focus on model size and inference quality**

## Q&A
- not limited to any compression technique
- we are going to be running these llms on a server/cloud contact dr arthur choi
- we have 3 milestones where we should present slides (expected sept, oct, nov)

## Takeaways/TO-DOs
- Find and Compare 3 open-source models that perform well for code debugging & refactoring code from one language to another
- Figure out if CodeBleu is going to be how we grab metrics or if there is something else we can follow
- Work on RAD- SRS and SDD
