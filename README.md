# 🚀 LLM Compression Trade-off Evaluator  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores **compression techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their impact on **inference quality** for **code-generation tasks**.  
The goal is to evaluate trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and efficiency, ultimately enabling **smaller, cost-effective models** without significantly compromising performance.
